# Days since last Dia like thing

Funny little countdown :)

I'll stop maintaining this site once either of the following happen:
- One of them achieves real ~agi~ usable agent that we can use daily 
- I get bored of updating

### Maintenance

Please create an issue for (or PR) any new ~shitty~ ai browsers !

Required info:
- Name
- URL (of source preferably, but news as a source also works)
- Publish date 

Note: I’m aware that I’m missing a few `AI browsers`. This is because I couldn’t find ; they’re just yet another `chromium fork`  / a specific date when they were first “announced” to the world.

### Disclaimer

No hate towards anyone :)
